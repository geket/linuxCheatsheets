#### Removing older, unused kernels
### Linux stores several versions of the kernel in case something breaks
### You can remove most of these kernels, they take up a fairly large amount of space
## Check your current kernel name
uname -r
# You will get an output such as
# 6.*.*-*-amd64
# 5.*.*-*-amd64
# 4.*.*-*-amd64

## List and remove kernel images
# List images on disk
dpkg --list | grep linux-image

## Automatically remove all images that system deems unnecessary
# This will also remove other packages, such as former dependencies
sudo apt autoremove --purge

## Making sure that the latest kernels work
# Update GRUB to make sure that latest Kernels are found
sudo update-grub
# Reboot the system to see if the kernels work
sudo reboot

#------------------------------------------------------------
#### Managing logs and temporary files
## Check disk usage of the journal
journalctl --disk-usage

### If you are running out of space on your root partition this would be wise to clean
### You can vacuum the size to a certain amount or delete anything older than a certain period
## Reduce journal size
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=500M 
## Delete logs older than seven days
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
